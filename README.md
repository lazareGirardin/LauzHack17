# LauzHack17
A new interactive experience to plan and discover new destinations!  

Unfortunately, our teammates were sick and we were just 2. Not completely finished ðŸ˜ž 

We have scrapped data to add multiple layers of cultural options eg, show towns with active nightlife, UNESCO sights, museums, parks, etc.
For now, the only filter checkbox implemented is the average temperatures per country. We can easily highlight groups of countries from the scrapped data. 
Also wanted to add a wishlist
And the "Surprise Me" selects a random location. We wanted it to be filtered by user choices of cultural interests.
Also we obviously wanted to make the relation to the API more flexible (simple fix). 

Hope you enjoy our very first use of javascript and D3 visualizations ðŸ™‚
